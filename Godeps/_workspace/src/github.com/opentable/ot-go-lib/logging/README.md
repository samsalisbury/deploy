# Logging

This is a partial reference implementation of the notes at https://wiki.otcorp.opentable.com/display/CP/Log+Proposals. It also includes a few extra features, enabling logging of whole request and response bodies, and headers, if desired.

For usage, please see the [godoc generated documentation](https://github.com/opentable/ot-go-lib/blob/master/logging/GODOC.txt)

To use: please follow the instructions in [the main ot-go-lib README](http://github.com/opentable/ot-go-lib/blob/master/README.md) to use Godep to link to this library.
